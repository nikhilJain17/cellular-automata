# Cellular Automata
Cellular automata are systems of cells that can be either alive or dead, and are governed by very simple rules. The most famous example of a cellular automata is Conway's Game of Life. These simple rules can lead to incredibly complex behavior. They also look super cool.

This is an example of a 1 dimensional cellular automata
